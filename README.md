# Youn Ink Four Color

This is a personal AI assistant project for ESP32-S3 e-ink devices. The current mainline consists of three parts: ESP32 firmware, a Python backend service, and photo/todo/device management pages.

The focus of this project is not a generic npm package, but a system that actually runs on an e-ink device: voice conversation, TTS playback, todo sync, weather/news/calendar/e-book/album pages, AP photo transfer, OTA firmware management, and a RawDraw UI adapted for four-color screens.

## 2BP Four-Color Image Pipeline

![Youn Ink Four Color 2BP BWRY architecture](README-2bp-architecture.png)

Album images can enter the server either from a PC/NAS management console or from the device's AP page, and are converted to `2BP BWRY` (black, white, red, yellow) before being pushed over Wi-Fi to the ESP32-S3 four-color e-ink screen. This repo's 2BP four-color pipeline is maintained independently from NOTE4's 4BP black/white grayscale album: panel colors, pixel formats, and refresh drivers all differ.

## Current Status

- The backend has switched to the Python service under `server/`; the old root-level Node `scripts/` has been removed.
- The firmware's main UI is rendered with RawDraw, designed by default for four-color screens, while still keeping 1bpp black/white compatibility.
- Themes currently keep a single default visual direction: a Nintendo-esque four-color theme, emphasizing the semantic use of red, yellow, black, and white.
- Image transfer supports both 1bpp black/white and 2bpp four-color BWRY formats.
- The root `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts, logs, pid files, databases, local config, and secret files.

```

Note: `firmware/scripts/` and `frontend/scripts/` are still in use, belonging to the firmware tooling and frontend tooling respectively; what was removed is the legacy root-level `scripts/`.

## Backend Service

The backend entry point is `server/llmserve.py`, best managed via `server/start.sh`. Default service ports:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `9001` | WebSocket | ESP32 voice, LLM, TTS, sync messages |
| `8766` | UDP | Device discovery |
| `8766` | HTTP | Image push, device image management, OTA API |
| `8090` | HTTP | Standalone management service, optional |

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the Service

```bash
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_api_key
cd server
./start.sh start
```

Common commands:

```bash
cd server
./start.sh status
./start.sh logs
./start.sh restart
./start.sh stop
```

You can also invoke these from the repo root:

```bash
npm run server:start
npm run server:status
npm run server:logs
```

### Local Mock Device

```bash
cd server
python3 mock_client.py --server ws://127.0.0.1:9001
```

## Photo and Device Management

The image HTTP API is served by `server/push_image.py` on port `8766`. It supports:

- Uploading an image file, converting it, and pushing it to the device.
- Choosing between `1bpp` black/white or `2bpp` four-color BWRY format.
- Querying the device's image list.
- Deleting device images.
- Uploading firmware and serving it for OTA download.

Common endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8766/api/status
curl http://localhost:8766/api/images
```

Example image upload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766/api/upload_image \
  -F "image=@/path/to/photo.jpg" \
  -F "format=bwry2bpp" \
  -F "title=Photo Title"
```

Once the device enters AP photo-transfer mode, connect your phone to the device's hotspot and visit:

```text
http://192.168.4.1
```

## Firmware

The firmware lives in `firmware/`, based on ESP-IDF. It targets the ZecTrix ESP32-S3 4.2" e-ink screen by default, supporting the four-color BWRY screen while also keeping a 1bpp black/white screen configuration.

### Build

```bash
cd firmware
source ~/Documents/esp/v6.0/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py build
```

Root-level helper command:

```bash
npm run firmware:build
```

### Screen Configuration

The firmware Kconfig has a screen type selection:

```text
ZECTRIX_EPD_PANEL_4COLOR_SSD2683  Four-color BWRY screen
ZECTRIX_EPD_PANEL_1BPP            Black/white 1bpp screen
```

To flash back to the old black/white screen, switch to `1bpp black/white EPD` in `idf.py menuconfig` first, then rebuild and reflash. The RawDraw theme layer will downgrade red/yellow semantic colors to a black/white-readable style.

## UI Overview

The firmware UI currently runs on the RawDraw component system. Key pages include:

- Conversation: displays user speech, recognition status, and AI replies.
- Todos: local display, server sync, complete/delete/edit.
- Settings: volume, brightness, theme, network, sync, OTA, etc.
- Album: thumbnail list, full-image view, AP photo-transfer entry point.
- Weather/weather details, news, almanac, year progress, calendar, e-books, logs.
- Quick-switch overlay: for fast navigation between pages.

The four-color screen theme layer draws components via semantic styles; adding bare `RED/YELLOW/BLACK/WHITE` directly in business pages is discouraged. Prefer RawDraw components and theme tokens when adding new UI.

### Button Controls

The device has three physical buttons: UP, DOWN, and BOOT/CONFIRM.

| Button | Click | Long press | Double-click |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UP | Context-sensitive (menu-up / previous item) | Only acts if already on Settings: exits back to Gallery | Opens/closes the quick-switch menu |
| DOWN | Context-sensitive (menu-down / next item) | Opens Settings (from any page) | Not wired to anything |
| BOOT/CONFIRM | Confirm/select (e.g. picks the highlighted quick-switch item) | Context-sensitive: exits WiFi-config-AP mode if active, else exits AP photo-transfer mode if running, else starts AP photo-transfer mode from Gallery, else voice push-to-talk | Not wired to anything (reserved for debug screenshot capture, but no hardware handler currently triggers it) |

UP + DOWN held together (long press) enters WiFi config mode (starts the device's config AP).

Note UP long-press does **not** open Settings — only DOWN long-press does. UP long-press only ever *exits* Settings back to Gallery, and is a no-op on every other page.

## Environment Variables

Common backend environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | none | DashScope (Bailian) API Key, required to start the backend |
| `LISTEN_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | WebSocket listen address |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | `9001` | WebSocket port |
| `DISCOVERY_PORT` | `8766` | UDP discovery port |
| `PUSH_IMAGE_PORT` | `8766` | Image/OTA HTTP API port |
| `TTS_WS_CHUNK_BYTES` | `8000` | TTS push chunk size |
| `TTS_WS_CHUNK_GAP_SEC` | `0.01` | TTS chunk send interval |
